# Chat Client

I'm pleased to present my first networking project, a feature-rich IRC chat client built with the ASIO (Asynchronous I/O) toolkit. As an early version, I've kept it basic by not incorporating wide area network (WAN) adaption straight into the client. However, I'd want to draw attention to a few essential components of the project:

### Built using ASIO
The project relies on ASIO, specifically from the boost library! Without ASIO, this project wouldn't have been possible.


### No WAN
The project doesn't currently include a WAN adapter, so this means you'll have to use a third party to connect to users around the world, such as something like Hamachi.

### Name 
This chat client currently goes by the name "Chat Client" as a placeholder. I have yet to create a name for it and in the future I most likely will and will come back to stylize the client some more.


I appreciate your interest in this project and welcome any feedback or ideas for its improvement, or just coming across this to learn something like me, feel free to take anything away from this! Please ask for my permission if you do end up trying to make a fork of this however. Thanks so much!
